    <Spiegazione>
System Monitor shows real-time performance data based on Object counters, and can display the
log data recorded by Performance Logs And Alerts either in the form of Counter (interval polling) logs, or
Trace (event-driven) logs. Logs written by Performance Logs And Alerts can be loaded into System Monitor for
analysis. The System Monitor is designed for real-time reporting of data to a console interface, and can be
reported in graph, histogram, or numeric form. This should aid you in ensuring that you meet the stated
requirements.

You are the network administrator for Application.com. All network servers run Windows Server 2003.
The network includes a file server named Application.com1. Application.com1 contains a single disk for system files and two SCSI hard disks that comprise a 72-GB mirrored volume with 65 GB of read-only data. Users
connect to this data by using shortcuts on their desktops.
Testking1 is scheduled for replacement. You have a scheduled maintenance window to complete this task.
Before the maintenance window, you build a new server.
You need to bring the new server online with current data and re-establish redundancy as quickly as
possible. You must also ensure that the desktop shortcuts will continue to function.
What should you do?

You have to make use of the existing old Application.com1 disks to make sure that the current data will
be brought online. When moving disks from one computer to another keep in mind that before disconnecting
the disks from the old Application.com1 you must make sure the status of all volumes on each of the disks is healthy.
For any volumes that are not healthy, repair the volumes before you move the disks. After you physically
connect the disks to the new TestKing1, in Disk Management, open the Action menu and choose Rescan Disks.
The scanning will detect changes. The new disk will show up as Dynamic/Foreign. By default,
Dynamic/Foreign disks and should be brought online automatically, but if not, bring it online by right-clicking
the disk and selecting Online.
To make Dynamic/Foreign disks useable, you must import it. The disk group remain as is and the database does
not change.
When connecting new Application.com1 to the network you will enable users to use their existing shortcuts.
